[Sticky notes]

Please create a user and login to the application.
## Information
Application is developed using plain javascript and i didn't use any javascript libraries while working on the application.<br />
All the functionalities have been Implemented.<br />
As said in the description i used local storage to store the data. And sessionstorage to store the login information.<br />
IE has [Issue] with localstorage so this application will not work with IE as well as edge.<br />
Firefox has some issue with addEventListener i tried my best to resolve it. Drag and drop wont work in firefox.<br />

I have provided all the comments in the code.

For the login functioanlity i have used single ton pattern
For actual application functionality i used factory pattern
